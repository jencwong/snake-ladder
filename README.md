# snake-ladder

Snake and ladder math addition game

The goal of the game is for the player to reach the finish line, square #100.

The player has to answer math questions. The player will start from square #0 and answers what position he or she lands on based on the rolls of the two dices.

The dices give out random numbers. The resut of the two dices will be the number of squares that the player advances to, if his/her answer is correct. If the answer is incorrect, the player will move back by the numbers from the dices.

The player repeat the process above until he/she reacheas the finish line, or the player has the option to reset the game.
